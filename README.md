This is my daily journey to become a CFD developer. I currently hold a 
bachelor's in physics and I am studying a master's in applied physics.

I have a quite decent background in physics and math, and I am becoming a 
software developer. I am fascinated for numerical algorithms and clean code.

I truly believe that daily practice and good planning are the key to fly
to the stars.
