This is my daily journey to become a CFD developer. I currently hold a 
bachelor's in physics and I am studying a master's in applied physics.

Becoming a software developer is an excited journey.

### Clean code
### Numerical algorithms

I truly believe that daily practice and good planning are the key to fly
to the stars.
